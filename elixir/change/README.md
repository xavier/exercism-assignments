# Change

Write a program that will correctly determine change to be given using the least number of coins

Write a program that will correctly determine the fewest number of coins
to be given to the user such that the sum of the coins' value would
equal the correct amount of change.

## For example

- An input of 15 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5)
  and one dime (10) or [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
- An input of 40 with [1, 5, 10, 25, 100] should return one nickel (5)
  and one dime (10) and one quarter (25) or [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

## Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ elixir bob_test.exs
```

(Replace `bob_test.exs` with the name of the test file.)


### Pending tests

In the test suites, all but the first test have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can unskip the next one by
commenting out the relevant `@tag :pending` with a `#` symbol.

For example:

```elixir
# @tag :pending
test "shouting" do
  assert Bob.hey("WATCH OUT!") == "Whoa, chill out!"
end
```

Or, you can enable all the tests by commenting out the
`ExUnit.configure` line in the test suite.

```elixir
# ExUnit.configure exclude: :pending, trace: true
```
